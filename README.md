# orcatoc

This an extension for Visual Studio Code that provides a separate toggleable TOC view in the sidebar.

## Features

This extension provides a separate toggleable TOC view in the sidebar. The TOC view is automatically populated with the contents of the ORCA output file that is currently open in the editor. The TOC view is generated by parsing the ORCA output file using regular expressions and setting up a tree view based on the results. The generated TOC view is a tree view with the titles of the headings in the ORCA output file and the corresponding line numbers. Clicking on a TOC entry will jump to the corresponding line in the ORCA output file. The TOC view can be toggled on and off by clicking on the `ORCA FILE OUTLINE` icon in the sidebar. The TOC view can also be toggled on by running the command `Show ORCA Outline` from the command palette. On Windows, the command palette can be opened with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, on Mac it is `Cmd+Shift+P`. The TOC view is automatically updated when navigating to a different ORCA output file.

## Requirements

N/A

## Extension Settings

The current version (0.2.1) of this extension does not have any settings.

## Issues and Important Notes

- Due to the memory limit of VS Code for large files, the extension will not work properly for very large ORCA output files (>50MB) because VS code will disable the `activeEditor`. To parse very large ORCA output files and generate the TOC view, the extension will need to be run in a separate process. This will be implemented in a future release. Currently, the extension will work for ORCA output files that are less than 50MB in size. If you have very large ORCA output files, please consider splitting them into smaller chunks or remove the parts that are not needed (for example full print of the MOs).

- If you don's see the `ORCA FILE OUTLINE` in the sidebar of `EXPLORER`, please make sure that the `OPEN EDITORS` drop down menu is expanded. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

## Release Notes

For detailed release notes, please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### 0.2.1

Bug fixes and optimizations.

## TODO

- [x] Automatically show TOC view when opening an ORCA output file
- [X] Support for large ORCA output files (<50MB).
- [ ] Automatically update TOC view when saving changes to an ORCA output file (additional command to manually refresh TOC view)
- [ ] Add support for enabling/disabling TOC view for specific file types
- [ ] Add support for controlling the showing level of TOC entries
- [ ] Add illustrations to this README
- [x] Add icon to this extension
- [x] Updating the list of regular expressions used to parse the ORCA output file

## Roadmap

The current version represents a very early release of this extension.

An important feature that will be added in the next major release is to enable the scrolling of the `ORCA FILE OUTLINE` view to the current line in the ORCA output file. This will be useful when the ORCA output file is very long and the user is navigating through the file. The `ORCA FILE OUTLINE` view will automatically scroll to the current line in the ORCA output file.

## For Developers

The list of regular expressions is saved in `patterns.json` file. The file contains a list of regular expressions that are used to parse the ORCA output file. Each regular expression is a JSON object with the following properties:

1. `regex`: The regular expression string
2. `level`: The level of the TOC entry (1, 2, 3, etc.)

Please submit a pull request if you would like to add a new regular expression to the list. Please also submit a pull request if you would like to modify an existing regular expression.
